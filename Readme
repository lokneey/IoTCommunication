This is full project of comunication between: device, server and web app. Project is easy to modify and extend due to its modular construction. 

The core of project is server REST api which manage and process sended data or data included in database. Api allows to add, remove, change users and messages. In this server app there is implemented JWT authoristion mechanizm.

Main user is ESP8266 device which can login, add message or post message by HTTP protocol. Microcontroller connects with server app sing login function to generate JWT token. When app has token it connects with server every 60s to receive 5 most important messages to display. Messages importance is set by server by message priority level and message expiry date. Posting message can be triggered any time (this job is but by other teammate, so it's not included on this repository). This part of projec is implemented using c++ in PlatformIO. All program and instructions what is needed to run it you can find in scr/main.cpp file.

Web app is created to be able to see what data is included in database. It also allows easy adding new users or messages via Internet (NFC communication from this app will be implemented in future). In this app I was also focused on the good appearance and responsiveness of the application. This app also allows to modify user password. I plan to add ability to modify every data of user, or message in the future.

If you have any question about this project you can find me on www.ipprograms.pl.
